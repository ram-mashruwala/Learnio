# Learnio

Learnio is a web platform that provides students with curated practice problems to reinforce classroom learning. This website has persistent data, functionality for problem categorization and a diverse range of difficulty levels.

## Refactoring in progress

### Q: What are we refactoring?

We are splitting the frontend code from the backend code to decrease coupling
of the code and to also learn new frameworks and technologies

In this refactoring, we are going to use Next.js with React for the frontend and flask with Python for the backend.
